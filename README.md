# CS 7642: Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making
### Background:
Developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with function approximation, and trained it in a modified version of the “Football” multi-agent environment originally developed by Google Research (Kurach et al. 2019). 
### Objective:
Implement an algorithm/solution that improves upon the baseline teams.
